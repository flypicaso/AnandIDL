bouquet of small and large IDL programs for everyone

These are a few of the programs written in IDL, the preferred language for solar physicists. One can use the programs equally well in the open-source GDL. These programs were written over the several years of my PhD and post-doc years, whenever a need to arose that was not met by the available libraries. Several of these assume the presence of the standard IDL libraries like astron and coyote.
